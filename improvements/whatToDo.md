3. Use Walk-Forward Time-Series Validation
The current objective uses a simple three-fold split that shuffles contiguous blocks (first third vs. second third, etc.). That risks leakage for time-series data because the validation fold may contain points that occur before part of the training fold.

Replace the fold logic with expanding-window or walk-forward validation. For example, successively train on [0, t) and validate on [t, t+h) to ensure the model is always tested on “future” data. This usually yields more robust parameters that generalize, increasing live returns.

4. Adapt the Acquisition Schedule Dynamically
The optimizer cycles through EI → PI → LCB (or uses a supplied schedule) but the schedule is fixed ahead of time.

Consider monitoring recent improvements (self.score_history) and switching acquisition functions based on whether exploitation or exploration is needed (e.g., stay on EI while improvement is strong, fall back to LCB when progress stalls). You could also adjust xi/kappa on the fly to inject more exploration once the GP appears to have converged.

5. Model Observation Noise Better
gp_minimize receives a constant noise term (default 1e-10).

Trading backtests are inherently noisy (slippage, random fills). Estimate variance of the score across folds and feed that as noise (or even per-point noise) to prevent the GP from overfitting to noisy evaluations. You can compute the fold variance in create_objective and return both mean and variance.


7. Introduce Multi-Fidelity or Hierarchical Optimization
Run cheap approximations (shorter history, fewer assets) first, and only promote promising candidates to a full backtest. You can implement this by wrapping backtest_func so it does a quick evaluation, and only if the CPS exceeds a threshold does it trigger the expensive full evaluation. This accelerates exploration, letting you afford more n_calls and discover higher-performing regions.

8. Parallelize Evaluation More Aggressively
The optimizer supports parallel strategy optimization via ProcessPoolExecutor, but individual parameter evaluations are still sequential.

If the backtest function is the bottleneck, explore batched acquisition (evaluate multiple points per GP iteration) or use n_jobs > 1 when fitting the GP if scikit-optimize supports it in your environment. Higher throughput means more samples within the same wall-clock budget, which generally increases the probability of finding higher-return configurations.
