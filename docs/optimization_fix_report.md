# Optimization Fix Report - September 11, 2025

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Timestamp Bug in BacktestEngine
**Problem**: The backtest engine was trying to perform arithmetic operations on string timestamps, causing TypeError when calculating hold_duration.

**Location**: `backtest_engine.py` lines 106, 214, 308-310

**Fix**: Added timestamp conversion from string to datetime objects:
```python
if isinstance(timestamp, str):
    timestamp = pd.to_datetime(timestamp)
```

### 2. Hardcoded Signal Strength Threshold
**Problem**: BacktestEngine had a hardcoded minimum signal strength of 0.5, overriding strategy-specific thresholds.

**Location**: `backtest_engine.py` line 113-114

**Fix**: Changed from hardcoded 0.5 to 0, allowing strategies to control their own thresholds:
```python
# Old: if signal_strength < 0.5:
# New: if signal_strength <= 0:
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- 621 tests run in first optimization
- 0 trades executed across ALL strategies
- All strategies returned 0.00% (no trading occurred)
- Optimization completed in 4.9 minutes

### After Fix (In Progress)
- Strategies now properly execute trades
- RSI test with threshold 0.0: 786 trades executed
- Optimization taking longer per test due to actual trade execution
- Expected to find strategies that may beat 22.29% Buy & Hold

## 3-Month Data Statistics
- **Data Points**: 25,921 rows
- **Date Range**: June 12, 2025 to September 10, 2025 (90 days)
- **Buy & Hold Return**: 22.29% ($1222.88 from $1000)
- **Start Price**: 198.32 WPLS/HEX
- **End Price**: 242.53 WPLS/HEX

## Current Status
- Archipelago optimizer running with fixed backtest engine
- Process ID: 5d1f25
- Started: ~5:17 AM PST
- Expected completion: Within 1 hour

## Next Steps
1. Monitor completion of current optimization run
2. Analyze results to find strategies beating 22.29% Buy & Hold
3. Document best performing strategies
4. Create hybrid strategies from top performers
5. Create git branches for successful improvements
